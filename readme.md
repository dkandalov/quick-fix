This is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEs which:
- Adds `Quick Fix` action to apply the first available quick fix (equivalent to pressing `alt+enter, enter`). `Quick Fix` is assigned to `F1` so you might need to unassign `F1` from the `Context Help` action.
- Registers all available intentions as actions so you can assign shortcuts to them (see [this youtrack issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-217465)). For example, if you have Java or Kotlin plugin enabled, you can use `Find Action` to search for "put arguments". The search results should include "Put arguments on one line (Intention)" line on which you can `alt+enter` and specify your own shortcut for this intention.

### What's wrong with Alt+Enter?
Pressing `alt+enter, enter` is too many key presses when you already know that the top inspection is going to do what you want.
To avoid this you can use `Quick Fix` action to apply the first available inspection.

Some intentions are used so frequently that pressing `alt+enter` and choosing the right row in the popup list becomes tedious.
It also doesn't help that depending on the context, the intention you're looking for might not be on the same row as it was before.
To solve this problem the plugin creates actions for all intentions so you can assign keyboard shortcuts and invoke intentions without any popup windows.
Note that all actions generated by the plugin have "(Intention)" postfix so you can distinguish them from other actions.

Finally, `alt+enter` is physically not the easiest shortcut, especially if you use it a lot...
As an experiment `Quick Fix` action is assigned to `F1` because it's a single key and located near `F2 - Next Highlighted Error`.
You might need though to unassign `F1` from the `Context Help` action which is mostly useless anyway.
